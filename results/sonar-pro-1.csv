While global trends and industry reports highlight growing demand and voluntary adoption of halal certification for pharmaceuticals in many markets[3][4], Cambodia's public halal policy and certification efforts have not specifically mandated it for pharmaceuticals as of August 2025.

However, there is no direct evidence from the cited sources that Malaysia enforces formal 'hospital-only' distribution, i.e., a strict legal or regulatory mandate allowing certain antimicrobials to be distributed exclusively to hospitals and not to community pharmacies or private sector environments. In the public sector, access to certain antimicrobials (including critical 'Reserve' antibiotics) is limited via the Ministry of Health (MOH) formulary, and practitioners in private sector settings face fewer restrictions[3]. Thus, while hospital-based restrictions and prescribing controls exist, explicit hospital-only distribution restrictions for antimicrobials as a legal or regulatory class-wide rule are not documented in the available sources.","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5017119/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9137524/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10762925/,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0149623,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.718774/full"
Publishes national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance data related to pharmaceutical products.,Malaysia,YES,"Malaysia publishes national AMR surveillance data related to pharmaceutical products, primarily through the National Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance (NSAR) reports. These reports analyze data from hospital microbiology laboratories across the country, tracking resistance patterns in clinical isolates and providing detailed statistics on antimicrobial resistance trends relevant to pharmaceuticals[1][2][5]. The NSAR is coordinated by the Institute for Medical Research under the Ministry of Health and has been operational for over two decades, with regular publication of surveillance data, most recently in 2023[1]. The program specifically covers resistance to antibiotics (pharmaceutical products) used in clinical settings, with data supporting public health action and policy development[1][2].","https://library.nih.gov.my/e-doc/imr/nsar-2023.pdf,https://www.dvs.gov.my/dvs/resources/user_1/2020/KAV/AMR/MyAP_AMR.pdf,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10764260/,https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rapid-Assessment-of-the-Regulatory-Measures-in-Combating-Antimicrobial-Resistance-AMR-in-the-ASEAN-Region_-Feb-2023-OK-1.pdf,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8573254/"
