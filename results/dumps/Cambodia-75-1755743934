However, Cambodia, as a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), generally aligns its pharmaceutical regulations with ASEAN guidelines and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines[1][5]. ICH Q1D, which details bracketing and matrixing approaches, is internationally recognized and forms the basis for regulatory frameworks in many countries, including ASEAN members[2][3][4]. Unless Cambodia has published regulatory restrictions specifically prohibiting these designs, it is probable but not certain that such approaches may be accepted when justified scientifically. Applicants should verify with the Cambodian Ministry of Health or relevant regulatory agency for the most current and explicit guidance.\"\n}",
