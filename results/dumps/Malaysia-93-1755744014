This requirement is specified in Article 8 (Obligations) of the MRA, which Malaysia signed in 2009, mandating mutual recognition of GMP certificates and avoiding duplication of inspections within ASEAN member states for finished medicinal products[2][4]. Malaysian regulatory guidance documents confirm implementation of this obligation through recognition of GMP evidence from ASEAN LIS[1][3].\"}",
