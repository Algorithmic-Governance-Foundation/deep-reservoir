        "content": "{\"answer\":\"YES\",\"note\":\"Thailand is legally required to accept and recognize Certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) issued by another ASEAN Member State's inspection service that is listed as an ASEAN Listed Inspection Service (LIS), as stipulated by the ASEAN Sectoral Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on GMP Inspection signed in 2009. Under Article 8 of the MRA, all ASEAN Member States, including Thailand, are obligated to operate a PIC/S-equivalent GMP inspection framework and accept GMP certificates and inspection reports issued by an AMS's LIS for finished pharmaceutical products[2][4]. This arrangement is intended to avoid duplicative inspections and streamline cooperation across ASEAN countries. However, Thailand may require further document verifications depending on the specific procedural track and the renewal status of GMP certificates[5].\"}",
