The international standard (ICH Q1D) is widely recognized and often adopted by many regulatory authorities, and references to stability testing generally point to ICH guidelines[1][2][4][5]. However, without explicit mention of Myanmarâ€™s local regulations or guidance, it is not possible to confirm definitively for Myanmar.
