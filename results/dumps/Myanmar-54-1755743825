However, the search results do not provide Myanmar-specific regulatory guidance confirming whether Myanmar will accept stability data at 25°C/60% RH supported only by accelerated data (e.g., 40°C/75% RH), or whether Myanmar explicitly requires 30°C/65% RH for its climatic zone. Regulations in many ASEAN and tropical countries require stability data at 30°C/65% RH due to their climatic conditions, but Myanmar's exact policy is not detailed in the provided sources. Reference to Myanmar's own National Regulatory Authority or MOH documentation would be required for a definitive answer.\"}",
