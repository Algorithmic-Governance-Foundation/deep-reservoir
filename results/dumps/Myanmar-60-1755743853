However, while clinical AMR data (e.g., resistance rates in bacterial isolates) are reported, there is insufficient evidence that Myanmar regularly or comprehensively publishes surveillance data specifically related to pharmaceutical products, such as antimicrobial usage or national sales data, especially in relation to pharmaceutical regulation or market analysis[1][4]. Surveillance of antimicrobial use is being developed and is recognized as a gap in Myanmar's AMR response, but current publicly available reports are limited to clinical resistance data rather than pharmaceutical product surveillance.\"}",
