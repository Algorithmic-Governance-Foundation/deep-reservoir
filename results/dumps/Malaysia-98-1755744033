Multiple sources indicate that the typical approval timelines for new chemical entities and biologics are between 245 and 515 calendar days, with the median time for standard reviews being approximately 515 days, and priority medicines approved at about 50% faster, but still well above six months[2][4][5]. Even recent trends show Malaysia's average approval time as between 400-500 calendar days, significantly longer than six months[5].\"}",
