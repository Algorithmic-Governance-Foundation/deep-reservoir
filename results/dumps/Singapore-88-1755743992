        "content": "{\"answer\":\"NO\",\"note\":\"Singapore does not target a marketing authorization (MA) approval timeline of six months or less for standard pharmaceutical products. According to recent and authoritative sources, the target processing timelines for drug registration in Singapore are: Full evaluation dossiers—processed within 270 working days (approx. 12 months), Abridged evaluation dossiers—processed within 120-240 working days (approx. 6-12 months), and Verification evaluation dossiers—processed within 60-120 working days (approx. 3-6 months). Most applications use the abridged or full route, resulting in typical timelines that exceed six months[3][1]. While the verification route can sometimes result in timelines below six months, this applies only to a small subset of products with prior approval from reference agencies, not the general case[3]. A survey of pharmaceutical industry players in Singapore reports average approval times of 12 to 22 months for MA applications overall[1], which is consistent with independent regulatory landscape reviews showing Singapore's mean approval times are closer to 400-500 days (13-16 months)[5].\"}",
