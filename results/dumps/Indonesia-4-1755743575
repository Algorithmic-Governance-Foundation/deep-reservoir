        "content": "{\"answer\":\"PARTIAL\",\"note\":\"Indonesia's BPOM generally requires stability data for pharmaceuticals at long-term conditions of either 25°C/60% RH or 30°C/65% RH, in line with ICH and ASEAN standards[4][5]. Accelerated studies (typically at 40°C/75% RH) can support submissions, but if only accelerated data are provided without 12 months long-term data at 25°C/60% RH, this is typically not accepted for full shelf-life assignment under standard pharmaceutical guidelines—unless a 'scientific justification' is provided and accepted by BPOM for products tested under different conditions[1]. Therefore, accelerated studies alone are not sufficient; long-term real-time data at 25°C/60% RH or equivalent are required for registration, but accelerated data may be used to justify shelf life in special cases, subject to regulatory acceptance.\"}",
