However, while halal certification is mandatory for food products and food businesses, certification for pharmaceutical products appears to be required only for products marketed or labeled as halal, not all pharmaceutical products in general[4]. Non-halal pharmaceutical products (such as non-oral medications and those not intended or advertised as halal) are not legally required to obtain halal certification[4].\"}",
