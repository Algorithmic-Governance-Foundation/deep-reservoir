However, an expedited pathway exists: for drugs already approved by reference regulatory agencies (such as PMDA, FDA, or EMA) and meeting certain criteria, the review timeline may be shortened to as little as 45 or 30 working days (1.5 to 6 weeks)[1]. Therefore, while the general target is not six months or less, eligible products may access significantly shorter timelines under facilitated pathways.[1]\"}",
