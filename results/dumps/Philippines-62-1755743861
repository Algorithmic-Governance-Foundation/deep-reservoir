However, current sources do not confirm that this portal is fully digital for the entire end-to-end process (including document uploads, status tracking, payments, and approvals) without the need for any physical documents or in-person steps. The referenced portals provide access to application submission and company registration, but full digitalization of all marketing authorization procedures has not been explicitly verified in recent regulations[1][5].\"}",
