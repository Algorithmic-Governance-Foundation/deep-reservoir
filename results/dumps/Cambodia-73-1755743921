        "content": "{\"answer\": \"PARTIAL\", \"note\": \"Cambodia does require pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide a Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), but the legal requirement is for a GMP certificate from the country of origin, not specifically requiring acceptance of another ASEAN Member State’s (AMS) cGMP certificate. While the ASEAN MRA on GMP (signed in 2009) obliges participating member states to recognize GMP inspections among themselves for medicinal products, there is no explicit evidence from the available sources that Cambodia has fully implemented this by automatically accepting another AMS's cGMP certificate for pharmaceuticals. For medical devices, Cambodia accepts a GMP or ISO certificate from the country of origin, which could be from another AMS, but this is not the same as a statutory obligation to accept all AMS certificates as equivalent[3][4][5].\"}",
