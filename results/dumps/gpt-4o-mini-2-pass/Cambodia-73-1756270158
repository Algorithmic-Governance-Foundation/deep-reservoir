          "content": "Yes, Cambodia legally requires the acceptance of another ASEAN Member State's (AMS) Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) for pharmaceutical manufacturers. This requirement is based on the ASEAN Sectoral Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Inspection of Manufacturers of Medicinal Products, signed by all ten ASEAN member states on April 10, 2009. ([cil.nus.edu.sg](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/databasecil/2009-asean-sectoral-mutual-recognition-agreement-on-good-manufacturing-practice-gmp-inspection-of-manufacturers-of-medicinal-products/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe MRA aims to facilitate the mutual recognition of GMP inspection outcomes among ASEAN countries, thereby eliminating the need for duplicate inspections and promoting the free flow of medicinal products within the region. Under this agreement, each AMS is obligated to accept GMP certificates and inspection reports issued by other member states' inspection services that are listed and recognized under the MRA. ([globalforum.diaglobal.org](https://globalforum.diaglobal.org/issue/march-2021/harmonization-of-gmp-inspection-and-benefits-to-asean-economic-community/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn Cambodia, the Ministry of Health (MOH) oversees the registration and regulation of pharmaceutical products. Imported medicines and medical products must be registered with the MOH, which requires documentation such as GMP or ISO certificates. The registration process typically takes three to six months, and the certificates are valid for three years from the date of issuance. ([trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/healthcare-resource-guide-cambodia?utm_source=openai))\n\nTherefore, Cambodian authorities are expected to accept GMP certificates from other ASEAN member states that comply with the MRA, streamlining the registration process for pharmaceutical manufacturers within the region.
