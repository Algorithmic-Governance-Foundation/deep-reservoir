          "content": "The Philippines is a signatory to the ASEAN Sectoral Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Inspection of Manufacturers of Medicinal Products, which was adopted on April 10, 2009.

The Philippines Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was officially included in the list of ASEAN Listed Inspection Services on January 7, 2020. ([npra.gov.my](https://www.npra.gov.my/index.php/en/industry-news-announcements/more-recent-updates/225-english/1527062-philippines-fda-included-in-list-of-asean-inspection-services.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nAs a result, the Philippines is legally obligated to accept GMP certificates and inspection reports from other ASEAN Member States' listed inspection services. This mutual recognition aims to streamline the registration process for medicinal products within the ASEAN region, reducing duplication of inspections and facilitating trade. ([globalforum.diaglobal.org](https://globalforum.diaglobal.org/issue/march-2021/harmonization-of-gmp-inspection-and-benefits-to-asean-economic-community/?utm_source=openai))\n\nTherefore, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the Philippines are required to accept GMP certificates from other ASEAN Member States' listed inspection services, in accordance with the ASEAN MRA on GMP.
