          "content": "In Singapore, pharmaceutical stability data submissions are guided by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q1A(R2) guidelines, which outline specific conditions for long-term, intermediate, and accelerated stability studies. For long-term stability testing, the recommended conditions are 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 60% relative humidity (RH) \u00b1 5% RH, or 30\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 65% RH \u00b1 5% RH, or 30\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 75% RH \u00b1 5% RH, depending on the climatic zone of the region. ([xinfuda-group.com](https://www.xinfuda-group.com/news/stability-testing-of-new-drug-substances-and-products.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nAccelerated stability studies are typically conducted at 40\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 75% RH \u00b1 5% RH for a duration of six months. These conditions are designed to simulate the effects of long-term storage in a shorter period, providing predictive insights into a product's shelf life. ([xinfuda-group.com](https://www.xinfuda-group.com/news/stability-testing-of-new-drug-substances-and-products.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn Singapore, which falls under Climatic Zone IVb characterized by high temperatures and humidity, the ASEAN Stability Guidelines are also relevant. These guidelines specify long-term testing conditions at 30\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 75% RH \u00b1 5% RH for a minimum of 12 months. Accelerated testing is performed at 40\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 75% RH \u00b1 5% RH for six months. ([stabilitystudies.in](https://www.stabilitystudies.in/stability-studies-key-regulatory-guidelines-for-global-compliance/?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven these guidelines, submitting stability data for pharmaceutical products stored at 25\u00b0C with 60% RH, even when supported by accelerated stability studies, may not align with the regulatory expectations in Singapore. The prevailing standards emphasize testing at higher temperatures and humidity levels to ensure product stability under local climatic conditions.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable to conduct stability studies at the conditions specified in the ASEAN Stability Guidelines to meet regulatory requirements in Singapore.
