          "content": "Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Sectoral Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Inspection of Manufacturers of Medicinal Products, adopted on April 10, 2009. ([cil.nus.edu.sg](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/databasecil/2009-asean-sectoral-mutual-recognition-agreement-on-good-manufacturing-practice-gmp-inspection-of-manufacturers-of-medicinal-products/?utm_source=openai)) This agreement aims to facilitate the movement of medicinal products within the ASEAN region by promoting mutual recognition of GMP inspection reports and certificates.\n\nUnder this MRA, ASEAN member states, including Indonesia, are obligated to recognize and accept GMP inspection reports and certificates issued by designated inspection services of other member states. This mutual recognition is intended to eliminate redundant inspections and streamline the approval process for pharmaceutical products within the region.\n\nIn practice, Indonesia's regulatory authority, the Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan (BPOM), has been actively involved in harmonizing pharmaceutical regulations with ASEAN standards. For instance, BPOM has participated in workshops aimed at developing mutual recognition arrangements for bioequivalence study reports, reflecting Indonesia's commitment to regional regulatory alignment. ([pom.go.id](https://www.pom.go.id/berita/workshop-on-the-development-of-a-mutual-recognition-arrangement-of-bioequivalence-study-reports?utm_source=openai))\n\nTherefore, Indonesia legally requires the acceptance of another ASEAN member state's GMP certificate for pharmaceutical manufacturers, as stipulated by the ASEAN MRA on GMP Inspection.
