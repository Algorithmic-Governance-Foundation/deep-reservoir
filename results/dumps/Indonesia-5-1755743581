The latest BPOM Regulation No. 6 of 2025 aligns Indonesiaâ€™s requirements with the ASEAN Guideline on Stability Study and Shelf Life of Health Supplements, which explicitly states that reduced designs such as bracketing and matrixing can be applied to stability testing when scientifically justified[1][2][3][5]. Thus, these approaches are permissible for both health supplements and, by alignment with ASEAN guidelines, for pharmaceutical products, provided proper scientific reasoning and documentation are provided.\"}",
