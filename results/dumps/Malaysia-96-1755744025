Prescription drugs (which contain scheduled poisons) are specifically excluded from mandatory halal certification, while over-the-counter medicines, supplements, and traditional medicines can be certified halal if producers seek it[2]. The official halal certification for pharmaceuticals is administered by JAKIM based on specific standards and guidelines[3], but it is not a blanket legal requirement for the pharmaceutical sector.\"}",
