Submitting only stability data at 25°C/60% RH, even when supported by accelerated stability studies, does not meet the standard requirements for Vietnam’s climate and regulatory expectations[1][4]. Accelerated data alone are supplementary; the principal data must match local climatic conditions, which for Vietnam means real-time, long-term studies at higher temperature and humidity than 25°C/60% RH[2][4].\"}",
