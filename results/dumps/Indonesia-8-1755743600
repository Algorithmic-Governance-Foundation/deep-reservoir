        "content": "{\"answer\":\"PARTIAL\",\"note\":\"Indonesia does target an average MA approval timeline of six months (approximately 130 working days) or less, but only for specific categories of drugs. For most pharmaceutical products:\\n\\n- **Priority drugs** (including orphan, pandemic, and public health drugs) and urgent products have approval timelines of **less than 150 working days** (about 6-7 months) and in some cases even below 100 working days (about 5 months)[5][3].\\n- **Generic drugs requiring bioequivalence data**: up to **150 working days** (about 7 months)[5][3].\\n- **New chemical entities, biologics, or innovative drugs**: up to **300 working days** (over 13 months)[5][3][1].\\n\\nWhile select urgent and priority categories align with a six-month or less target, standard new drug applications typically exceed this timeframe, indicating six months or less is not the universal standard target for all pharmaceutical products in Indonesia.\"}",
