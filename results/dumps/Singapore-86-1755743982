Available sources indicate that while some ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia are introducing mandatory halal certification for pharmaceuticals, these requirements do not apply in Singapore[5]. In Singapore, halal certification is primarily relevant for food, beverages, and other consumer goods. Halal certification for pharmaceuticals in Singapore remains voluntary and is not a legal or regulatory requirement[3][5].\"}",
