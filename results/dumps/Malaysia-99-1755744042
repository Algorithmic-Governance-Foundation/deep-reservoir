        "content": "{\"answer\":\"PARTIAL\",\"note\":\"Malaysia imposes restrictions on the distribution and use of certain classes of antimicrobial pharmaceuticals within hospital settings, primarily through its Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) and formulary systems in public sector hospitals. Specific antimicrobial agents are designated as 'restricted' and require prior authorization for use, particularly in government hospitals[1][3]. However, there is no direct evidence from the cited sources that Malaysia enforces formal 'hospital-only' distribution, i.e., a strict legal or regulatory mandate allowing certain antimicrobials to be distributed exclusively to hospitals and not to community pharmacies or private sector environments. In the public sector, access to certain antimicrobials (including critical 'Reserve' antibiotics) is limited via the Ministry of Health (MOH) formulary, and practitioners in private sector settings face fewer restrictions[3]. Thus, while hospital-based restrictions and prescribing controls exist, explicit hospital-only distribution restrictions for antimicrobials as a legal or regulatory class-wide rule are not documented in the available sources.\"}",
