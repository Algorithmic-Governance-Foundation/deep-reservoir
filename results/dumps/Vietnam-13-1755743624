According to regulatory standards, pharmaceutical manufacturers operating in Vietnam must comply with local requirements based on WHO GMP standards, and certificates must be approved by the Vietnamese authorities, specifically the Ministry of Health and the Drug Administration of Vietnam[2][4]. There is no legal provision for automatic mutual recognition or mandatory acceptance of cGMP certificates issued by other ASEAN members for pharmaceuticals. Facilities with expiring ASEAN GMP certificates must still obtain WHO GMP certification in Vietnam to continue operation[2]. Please note that this does not apply to cosmetics, where the ASEAN CGMP may be recognized[1][3][5].\"\n}",
