        "content": "{\"answer\":\"UNKNOWN\",\"note\":\"The available search results confirm that Singapore has comprehensive national strategies and strong antimicrobial stewardship programs, with surveillance and optimization of antimicrobial use in hospitals being a key focus[1][2][3][5]. However, there is no explicit mention in the sources of statutory or regulatory hospital-only distribution restrictions for specific classes of antimicrobial pharmaceuticals. The sources detail efforts to control AMR predominantly in hospital settings and discuss stewardship, but do not clarify if certain antimicrobials are legally or formally restricted to hospital-only distribution. Therefore, based on current information, it cannot be confirmed that Singapore imposes such specific distribution restrictions.\"}",
