For new chemical entities (NCEs) and other new drugs, the registration process typically takes between 220 and 280 working days (approximately 10-14 months), while generic drugs take about 155 working days (roughly 7-8 months)[3]. Overall registration timelines can range from 6 months to 2 years, as the process is described as time-consuming, especially for innovator drugs[1].\"}",
