International sources (including ICH Q1A(R2) and EMA guidelines) permit long-term stability data at 25°C/60% RH, supported by accelerated studies, but Zone IV countries—which include many climates similar to Brunei—often require 30°C/75% RH or 30°C/65% RH stability data for submissions. Brunei's exact requirement cannot be confirmed from the provided information. For regulatory certainty, direct reference to Brunei's national authority or published guidelines is necessary.\"}",
