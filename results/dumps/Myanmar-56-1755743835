The halal certification landscape in Myanmar is characterized by a fragmented system focused primarily on the food industry, with multiple organizations issuing halal certificates but no centralized or standardized framework for pharmaceuticals[5][4]. While multinational agencies and local organizations do offer halal certification for various products, there is no evidence from authoritative or regulatory sources to indicate a legal or regulatory requirement for halal certification specifically for pharmaceuticals in Myanmar. In contrast, some ASEAN countries like Indonesia and Malaysia mandate halal certification for pharmaceuticals, but Myanmar does not[2][1][3].\"\n}",
