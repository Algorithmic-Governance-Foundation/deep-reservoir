The system aims to enable digital submission and streamline the registration process; however, available evidence from these sources indicates ongoing implementation and technical assistance as of 2019, with no explicit confirmation that the portal is fully digital end-to-end and universally operational for all applicants as of 2025[1][3][5]. Certain features like dossier submission and workflow management are included, but the full functionality, universal access, and maturity of the portal cannot be definitively confirmed based solely on these sources.\"}",
