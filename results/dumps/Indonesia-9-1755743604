Evidence from multiple sources indicates that antibiotics and other antimicrobials are widely available outside hospitals, including through community pharmacies, drug stores, and even informal vendors, with over-the-counter sales, self-medication, and widespread non-prescription access documented[2][1]. There is no indication in the available literature or health system reviews that any antimicrobial class is subject to a hospital-only distribution policy or regulatory restriction; antibiotics are dispensed by a variety of providers and channels across both hospital and community settings[2][1][4].\"}",
