While Laos has issued new regulations on biopharmaceuticals as of early 2025, these documents do not address the specific stability study methodologies permitted[5]. In many countries, including those referencing ICH guidelines, bracketing and matrixing designs are allowed with justification, but there is no specific information confirming Laosâ€™ stance on these ICH Q1D-based approaches[2][4]. It is recommended to consult directly with the Laos Ministry of Health or local regulatory consultants for authoritative guidance.\"}",
