        "content": "{\"answer\":\"PARTIAL\",\"note\":\"Brunei's specific regulatory acceptance of bracketing and matrixing designs in stability testing is not directly confirmed in available sources. However, Brunei has been referenced in international pharmaceutical regulatory discussions and typically aligns with global standards such as the ICH guidelines for stability testing[3]. The ICH Q1D guideline—which covers bracketing and matrixing study designs[2][4][5]—is adopted in many regulatory jurisdictions and is widely accepted as a best practice. If Brunei follows ICH standards (as is common with countries aiming for international harmonization), bracketing and matrixing would generally be allowed, but explicit confirmation from Brunei's own regulatory agency is lacking in the search results. Thus, while international practices suggest likely allowance, direct regulatory confirmation for Brunei is not available.\"}",
