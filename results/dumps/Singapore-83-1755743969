All AMS, including Singapore, are obliged to recognize and accept such certificates without duplicating GMP inspections within each other's territory[2][5]. This is incorporated in the regulatory framework of Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA)[2][5][1]. However, HSA reserves the right to further inspect if there are specific regulatory concerns[3]. Certificates from non-LIS sources or third-party schemes are not accepted[4].\"}",
