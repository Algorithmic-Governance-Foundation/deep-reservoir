However, implementation is subject to specific conditions: the certificates must come from agencies following PIC/S guidelines and quality system requirements[4], and for the Philippines, acceptance may also depend on the completeness of the submitted documents and potential need for additional inspections[5]. Therefore, while there is a legal framework supporting acceptance, in practice, the Philippines may require further verification or inspection before fully accepting other ASEAN states' GMP certificates.\"}",
